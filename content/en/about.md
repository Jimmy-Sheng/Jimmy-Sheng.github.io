I am a Financial Technology student at The Chinese University of Hong 
Kong,
with practical experience across traditional banking institutions
and large-scale fintech platforms.

My academic background combines finance, economics, programming,
and optimization, while my professional experience spans
Hang Seng Bank, Bank of East Asia, and Ant Group.

I am particularly interested in Open Banking,
data visualization, and AI-driven financial advisory systems.
